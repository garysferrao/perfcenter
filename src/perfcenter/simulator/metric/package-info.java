/**
This package contains the classes that provide metric hierarchy for collecting observed values during simulation.
<p>
The package abstracts the collection and processing of value from the main simulation logic. Any post-processing
of the collected values can be done in this package, making it a central place for any kind of data-processing and
post-processing.
